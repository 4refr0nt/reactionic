{"name":"React-Ionic","tagline":"Create iOS and Android apps with React and Ionic","body":"## React and Ionic: a Perfect Match\r\n\r\n[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) are a great combination:\r\n\r\n* React is the **best thing ever** that happened to front-end development\r\n* Ionic allows you to **quickly build iOS and Android apps** that are indistinguishable from native apps.\r\n\r\nThere are other options to create hybrid mobile apps, but Ionic is the most robust and mature. So if you prefer React over Angular, give React-Ionic a try!\r\n\r\n## Is this for me?\r\n\r\nReact-Ionic is useful for you if you:\r\n\r\n* Want to create an iOS and/or Android app coding in **Javascript**.\r\n* Like **React**, or don't mind learning it (you won't regret it; ask me for how to get started).\r\n* Optionally: Use **Meteor** (this is basically a clone of [Meteoric](http://meteoric.github.io/), but without a dependency on Meteor).\r\n\r\n# [Get Started!](https://github.com/pors/reactionic)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
